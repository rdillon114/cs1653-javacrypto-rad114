##Compile
Compile my program by entering the following command into the command prompt:
javac -cp .:/afs/cs.pitt.edu/usr0/adamlee/public/cs1653/bcprov-jdk15on-155.jar Homework1.java

##Run
After compiling my program, run it by entering the following into the command prompt:
java -cp .:/afs/cs.pitt.edu/usr0/adamlee/public/cs1653/bcprov-jdk15on-155.jar Homework1

while it is running, follow the on screen prompts to test its functionality.
You can only run one algorithm at a time, so the program will need to be run 3 times.
